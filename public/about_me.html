                        <hr>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Stacy Harris</strong> is a licensed
                            <strong>Marriage and Family Therapist</strong> specializing in
                            <strong>individual, couples and family therapy</strong>. She maintains a private practice in
                            <strong>Redding, CA</strong> and has over nine years experience providing
                            <strong>therapy</strong> and
                            <strong>counseling</strong>. She received her Master's in Psychology Counseling in 2003. She has received additional training in
                            <strong>Parent Child Interactive Therapy</strong>, led parenting groups through
                            <strong>Shasta County</strong> Office of Education; Early Childhood Services and is
                            <strong>certified in EMDR</strong>, a highly effective way to treat trauma related issues.

                            <p>She chose this profession because she deeply values the enrichment and preservation of relationships. She has been married for over thirty years and has five children, which give her a valuable perspective on the importance
                                of relationships. She enjoys
                                <strong>counseling</strong> with people, and providing a non-judgmental, caring and
                                <strong>safe environment</strong>. She likes working with individuals, couples, children, and adolescents on a variety of issues including
                                <em>anxiety, depression, stress management, grief and loss, trauma, parenting concerns, relationship
                                    problems and relationship enrichment</em>, particularly the one with our self.

                                <p>Her approach to helping clients successfully face personal life challenges is
                                    <strong>collaborative</strong>,
                                    <strong>supportive</strong> and
                                    <strong>goal oriented</strong>. Her emphasis in
                                    <strong>therapy</strong> is from a Cognitive Behavioral (CBT) perspective, which emphasizes the importance of our thoughts and how they drive our emotions and behavior. She combines interventions consistent with CBT
                                    to offer an extremely personalized approach that fits each client. She is committed to helping clients achieve the personal growth they are seeking and she does this with understanding and compassion.
