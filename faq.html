		<h2>Frequently asked questions<br>
		About Therapy</h2>
		<hr>

		<p>Many people have questions about <strong>therapy</strong>.  Here you can find answers to many of the common questions.  Feel free to <a href="contact.html">contact me</a> if you can't find your answer here.  We also have a <a href="learning_center.html">learning center</a> with in depth information about various therapy-related topics.</p>

		<p class="question">What is a Marriage and Family Therapist?</p>

		<p class="answer">
			Marriage and <strong>family therapists</strong> (MFTs) are psychotherapists and healing arts practitioners licensed by the state of <strong>California</strong>.
			<br>
			<br>
			MFTs assist with a wide variety of issues ranging from <em>addictions, depression, child behavior and elder concerns</em>. 
			<br>
			<br>
			The terms &quot;marriage, <strong>family</strong> and child counselors&quot; (MFCCs) and &quot;marriage and <strong>family</strong> therapists&quot; (MFTs) are used interchangeably. All states that regulate the profession use the title &quot;marriage and <strong>family</strong> therapist. &quot;
			<br>
			<br>
			Marriage and <strong>family therapy</strong> is highly effective because of the &quot;systemic&quot; orientation that its therapists bring to treatment. 
			<br>
			<br>
			MFTs believe that an individual's emotional issues and concerns must be treated within the context of his or her current or prior relationships if the gains are to be meaningful and productive for the patient.
		</p>

		<p class="question">What are the qualifications for a <strong>California</strong> licensed marriage and <strong>family</strong> therapist?</p>

		<p class="answer">
			Marriage and <strong>family</strong> therapists are licensed by the State of <strong>California</strong>. 
			<br>
			<br>
			MFTs have completed extensive education, training, clinical fieldwork, and successful completion of two rigorous exams to demonstrate professional competency. 
			<br>
			<br>
			Requirements for licensure include a related two-year master's or doctoral degree passage, of comprehensive examinations, and completion of at least 3,000 hours of supervised experience.
		</p>

		<p class="question">What is the difference between a MFT, LCSW, Psychologist, and Psychiatrist?</p>

		<p class="answer">
			MFT or LMFT: Licensed Marriage and Family Therapist with a master's degree in psychology, <strong>counseling</strong> psychology, clinical psychology, or marital and <strong>family therapy</strong>. Emphasis is on primary service in <strong>counseling</strong> and psychotherapy from a variety of therapeutic orientations with individuals, couples, families, and groups.
			<br>
			<br>
			LCSW: Licensed Clinical Social Worker with a master's degree in clinical social work. Emphasis on primary service in psychosocial diagnosis, assessment and treatment, client advocacy, consultation, evaluation and research.
			<br>
			<br>
			Psychologist: Possesses a doctoral degree in psychology or a related field with a license to practice <strong>therapy</strong> and conducts psychological testing and research.
			<br>
			<br>
			Psychiatrist: A medical doctor who specializes in psychiatry. Emphasis on primary service in prescribing and monitoring psychotropic medications and sometimes offers psychotherapy.
		</p>

		<p class="question">What should I ask a potential therapist?</p>

		<p class="answer">
			Inquire about the therapist's training, licensure status, and commitment to his or her professional development. 
			<br>
			<br>
			Ask what type of <strong>therapy</strong> is utilized. How is this different from other types of <strong>therapy</strong>? What should you expect?
			<br>
			<br>
			Does the therapist have a treatment agreement? The treatment agreement will likely cover fees, appointments, cancellations, limits of confidentiality, etc.
		</p>

		<p class="question">What should I ask myself?</p>

		<p class="answer">
			What do I hope to gain from <strong>therapy</strong>? Will this therapist help me do that? 
			<br>
			<br>
			Am I comfortable with this therapist? Would I want to come back?
			<br>
			<br>
			Remember: The most important factor in securing effective <strong>therapy</strong> is a good relationship between you and your therapist.
			<br>
			<br>
			Do I feel assured that the therapist is qualified to help me with the issues or concerns that have motivated me to seek <strong>therapy</strong> at this time?
			<br>
			<br>
			Am I willing to do the work necessary to participate in <strong>therapy</strong>?
		</p>

		<p class="question">Will <strong>therapy</strong> work for me?</p>

		<p class="answer">
			Research supports the assertions that <strong>therapy</strong> works for most clients.
			<br>
			<br>
			Many report relief from depression, anxiety, relationship problems, and issues affecting the elderly amongst numerous other issues.
			<br>
			<br>
			Many also report seeking <strong>therapy</strong> as a means of personal growth and exploration.
		</p>

		<p class="question">How long are <strong>therapy</strong> sessions?</p>

		<p class="answer">
			Sessions are typically between 45 minutes and 50 minutes, but may be shorter or longer depending upon the treatment approach.
		</p>


		<p class="question">How confidential are the sessions?</p>

		<p class="answer">
			Information disclosed by patients is generally held as confidential except for disclosure required or permitted by law.
		</p>


		<p class="question">I tried <strong>therapy</strong> before and it didn't work, why should I try it again?</p>

		<p class="answer">
			Sometimes the chemistry between the therapist and client or the therapeutic modality just isn't a good fit. Just as you sometimes have to switch medication, you may need to switch therapists or treatment modalities to achieve success.
			<br>
			<br>
			<strong>Therapy</strong> works best when you are open to it and are actually willing to participate in your own healing.
